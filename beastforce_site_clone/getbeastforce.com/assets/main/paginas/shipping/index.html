        <h5>Processing Time</h5>
        <p>
          Orders typically take <strong>1–2 business days</strong> to process before being shipped. Please note that during holidays, processing times may be longer. Incorrect or incomplete payment/address details may cause an additional <strong>3–5 business days</strong> delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: All U.S. shipping addresses are verified through USPS. Please verify your address at USPS.com (not applicable to international orders).
        </p>
        <p>We ship Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and U.S. public holidays.</p>

        <h5>Domestic Delivery Time – Standard Shipping</h5>
        <p>
          Delivery times vary depending on the selected shipping method and exclude weekends and holidays. All times are estimates. Rambo Max is not responsible for delays caused by factors beyond our control, such as severe weather, labor strikes, or transportation issues.
        </p>

        <h5>Refused, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages</h5>
        <p>
          If a package is refused upon delivery, the shipping fee will be deducted from your refund. Refunds for refused packages are issued only after the product is received and inspected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We primarily use UPS for shipments. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee replacements for lost or stolen packages once shipped. If you experience delays or issues with delivery, please contact us. Rambo Max is not liable for lost, stolen, or delayed packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: International shipping may take 4–6 weeks, and in rare cases up to 8–12 weeks, depending on customs clearance. Additional shipping fees may apply for certain countries.
        </p>

        <h5>Order Cancellation</h5>
        <p>
          Due to high order volume, once placed, your order immediately enters fulfillment. To cancel, you must contact us within 24 hours of purchase. Orders already processed or shipped cannot be canceled. If shipped, you may refuse the package or return it with a valid tracking number for a refund once received.
        </p>

        <h5>Wrong Address Disclaimer</h5>
        <p>
          Buyers are responsible for entering the correct shipping address. Rambo Max is not responsible for packages shipped to incorrect addresses provided by the customer. If a package is returned to us, you may choose between reshipment or refund.
        </p>

        <h5>Delivery of Items</h5>
        <p>
          If tracking information shows that your order has been delivered but you did not receive it, please contact USPS for further assistance. Rambo Max does not provide refunds for such cases.
        </p>

        <h5>Returns</h5>
        <p>
          To receive a full refund, all bottles (full, empty, or partially used, including any bonus or free bottles) must be returned within 60 days of your original purchase date. Please include a note with the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Order ID (from your receipt)</li>
          <li>Your full name and delivery address</li>
          <li>Your email address and phone number</li>
          <li>Your original packing slip (if available)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Failure to return all bottles may result in a partial refund.</em></p>
        <p>
          Returns must arrive at our facility within 60 days of purchase. You are responsible for return shipping costs. Refunds are issued once items are received and verified, usually appearing within 3–5 business days depending on your bank.
